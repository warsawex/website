      <hr />
      <p>
        We created warsaw.ex to bring together Alchemists and provide a place
        for the community to grow and learn. Our mission is to share knowledge
        and help anyone interested in using Elixir.
      </p>
      <p>
        During each of our meetups, we introduce new speakers who explain the
        traits and recipes for Elixir programming. Weâ€™re a non-profit community
        of programmers and our events are free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to the sponsors that support us we can host meetups each month.
      </p>
      <p>Join us, thereâ€™s loads to discover, and we have beer ðŸ˜‰</p>
